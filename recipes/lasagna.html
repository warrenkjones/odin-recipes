            <li>

            <li>

            </li>
            <li> 
                1 teaspoon fennel seeds
            </li>
            <li> 
                1 teaspoon ground oregano
            </li>

            <h2> Instructions</h2>

            <ol>
                <li> In a large pot over medium heat, add in ground sausage and ground beef. Use a spoon to break up the meat into small 
                    pieces. Add in onion and garlic and cook until meat is well browned, stirring constantly. Stir in sugar, fresh basil, 
                    fennel, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup chopped parsley. Pour in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, 
                    tomato sauce, and wine*. Stir well and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer 1-4 hours, stirring 
                    occasionally.

                </li> 
                <li> Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles into the bottom of a pan. Pour hot tap water directly over the noodles, making sure the pasta is 
                    completely immersed in the water. Let them soak for 30 minutes, then drain and discard water. </li>
                    <li> In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta 
                        cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg. Refrigerate until ready to assemble lasagna.

                    </li>
                    <li> Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease a deep 9x13 pan.

                    </li>
                    <li>To assemble, spread about 1 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of the prepared pan. Place 4 noodles on top. Spread with 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/4 of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, then sprinkle with 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. Repeat layering two more times to create three complete layers. To finish, place a final layer of pasta, topped with another 
                        1 cup of meat sauce to cover the pasta. Top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover loosely with aluminum foil.


                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes to allow cheese to brown. Serve hot.
