    <p> Along with hot dogs and hamburgers, barbecued chicken 
        is about as classic as it gets when it comes time for grilling.</p>
        <h2> The Trick To Good Grilled BBQ Chicken</h2>
        <p> But chicken takes longer to cook than either hot dogs or hamburgers and loves lower cooking temperatures, so it's easy to mess up by under-cooking, over-charring, or both. The trick to good BBQ Chicken?

            Patience.</p>

            <h2> Ingredients </h2>
            <ul> 
                <li> 4 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken parts 
                    (legs, thighs, wings, breasts)</li>
                    <li> Kosher salt</li>
                    <li> Extra virgin olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
                    <li> 1 cup barbecue sauce</li>
            </ul>
            <h2> Steps </h2>
            <ol> 
                <li> Coat the chicken pieces with olive 
                    oil and sprinkle salt over them on all sides.</li>
                <li>Prepare one side of your grill for high, direct heat. </li>
                <li>Lay the chicken pieces skin side down on the hottest side of the grill in order to sear the skin side well. Grill uncovered for 5 to 10 minutes, 
                    depending on how hot the grill is (you do not want the chicken to burn). </li>
                <li>Turn the chicken pieces over and baste them with with your favorite barbecue 
                    sauce. Cover the grill again and allow to cook for another 15 to 20 minutes. </li>
                <li> Sear a final time, then remove from heat</li>
                <li> Use a clean 
                    brush to paint the cooked chicken with more barbecue sauce and serve.</li>
            </ol>
